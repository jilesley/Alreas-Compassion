    content: `<p>The party started the session outside Corollas’ Museum in Marisberg ready to investigate  the stolen black glass. Upon arriving we learned that Belrim was not able to join us due to having a massive hangover from the previous night, so Varic had come in his place.</p>
    <p>We were led inside to start our investigation. The exhibits were all held in the basement, behind a door with both a magical and non-magical lock - though neither appeared to have been damaged/tampered with. Corollas lead us down and showed us the exhibits.</p>
    <p>Once down there, someone noticed that there was a part of the wall that appeared slightly different from the rest, almost like the mortar in that area was fresher than the others. Varic started to feel up the wall to check for any hidden buttons etc. Tieron found some water and manipulated it into a small crack in the wall, then froze the water to expand the crack. This loosened some of the bottom bricks, allowing Varic to knock some out of the way. When he done this, fresh loose dirt flowed out from behind it. Varic pushed his glaive into the dirt to see how far it reached - it appeared to be at least the length of the glaive.</p>
    <p>While this was happening, Orthon was being shown the other exhibits by Corollas. The notable exhibits were;</p>
    <ul><li>A bookshelf with a wide range of books</li>
    <li>Three sets of mannequins - two with armour, one without</li>
    <li>Architectural plans for various historic/famous buildings</li>
    <li>A dragon skull</li>
    <li>The podium where the black glass was held</li></ul>
    <p>Corollas clearly did not want to talk about the mannequin that was missing armour, but no one pressed him on it.</p>
    <p>Someone spotted a dirt footprint on the ground beside the podium that held the black glass. It appeared to be a dwarven footprint. As the party couldn’t find anything else, and the wall appeared to be completely blocked from the other side, the party started to leave the building. As they were leaving, Tieron discovers a letter on the table. It read;</p>
    <div class='note'><p>	Still one gold left.</p>
    <p>		-N</p></div>
    <p>Before Orthon left the building, he gives a donation to the museum, as Corollas had mentioned that he had been struggling to sustain it. This made Corollas pull Orthon aside and confess that he had not told the party everything. He told Orthon that he owed money to a man called Nellis, a shady dealer that ran casinos and other illicit businesses in the city. Apparently he could be found at one of his ‘establishments’, by the docks or In the tavern in the evenings. Orthon rejoined the party and relayed Corollas’ confesion.</p>
    <p>The party decided to go to investigate the area of the subterranea nearest to the museum. While searching the area, they come across a dingy bar where a few guys were gambling and one guy was completely pissed. Varic walked into the bar and announces; “We are looking for a man named Nellis.” To this all of the men in the bar look up and quickly look back to their games etc upon seeing who the announcement came from. Varic then walks up to the nearest table and puts his hands on the shoulders of two of the men and repeats; “We are looking for a man named Nellis.” this time with an intimidation check. He succeeded, but one of them said they don’t know what he’s talking about, and to piss off. The other starts walking behind the bar and opens a door slightly, calling out; “Hey boys, we got someone here lookin’ for Nellis.” The door opens and two more men come out. Both of them look identical to the first that called them out. All three of them pull out clubs from behind the bar.</p>
    <p>Upon seeing this Orthon steps in, asking for everyone to calm down. He states that they are conducting an investigation for a particular item and that they merely wish to talk to Nellis to help get more information. When they hear investigation, the three triplets get angrier, one of them asking: “Well who sent you on this investigation then?” Varic responds with “Corollas”. This pisses the three triplets off even more. Tieron then tried to cast Sleep on them, but fails on all three. When the triplets see this they jump over the bar to start a fight. However, one of them trips and is knocked prone.</p>
    <p>When the triplets jump over the bar, the party gets ready to attack, except for Orthon, who tries desperately to persuade everyone to calm down but is completely ignored. Hieronymus gets in two good punches on one of them and Artiti shoots an arrow into the triplet that was knocked prone. Varic gives the third a good punch as well, but then the two standing triplets start swinging with their clubs at Varic and Hieronymus, who each get hit once. The third then stands up and breaks off the arrow shaft that Artiti hit him with. Orthon then steps in and grapples the triplet who just stood up.</p>
    <p>As the Sleep failed, Tieron casts a spell that makes one of the triplets believe that the earth is wrapping around his feet, immobilising him. Hieronymus then goes to punch the same triplet he punched earlier, but critically misses and gets a smack from the triplet in response knocking Hieronymus unconscious. Seeing this, Varic takes out his Glaive, runs his hand across the blade, causing it to burst into blue flames in reaction to his blood. He swings at the triplet, causing serious damage. The triplet clobbers him in response, knocking Varic unconscious. The twin then swings at Orthon, breaking him out of the grasp he had on the third triplet.</p>
    <p>Orthon then punches the triplet who had just hit him and knocked Varic unconscious, to little effect. Tieron then sends a ball of lightning into the triplet who Hieronymus punched, killing him. Artiti shoots an arrow at the triplet who believes the earth is binding his feet, also killing him. Orthon then makes another punch at the last triplet, hoping to just knock him unconscious rather than have another death. The triplet shrugs it off and responds with two smacks of his club. Orthon also falls unconscious. Tieron then freezes the triplets legs - immobilizing him and Artiti finishes him off with a non-lethal shot to the knee.</p>
    <p>The remaining triplet is tied up and the unconscious members of the party are stabilised and eventually wake up again. The triplet reveals that he’s one of Nellis’ goons and that Corollas sold them a suit of armour to help pay off some of the debt he owes them. When searching the bar/bodies, some coins are found along with a note. The note read;</p>
    <div class='note'><p>Meet me under the temple</p>
    <p>	-P</p></div>
    <p>When asked who P was, the triplet said that it was likely Perin who had hired some of Nellis’ goons for some kind of heist job a couple of weeks ago. This matched up time wise with when the black glass was stolen. As the party was cleaning up and preparing to leave, the triplet said; “Tell Corollas that they won’t forget this, and more of Nellis’ men will be coming his way.” Varic then draws his glaive and cuts him in half. Shocked and disgusted at this, both Orthon and Tieron storm out of the bar, heading towards the temple.</p>
    <p>The other three start to clean up the bar and try to make it look like it was just a bar brawl that got out of hand, so that there wasn’t any connection to the party. While they are doing this, Orthon and Tieron arrive at the temple and warn the priests there of Nellis’ men being under the temple. The priests thank them for the warning and offer some potions of healing at a much reduced rate. Orthon buys two before the rest of the party meet up with them and they all take a short rest with some meat pies that Varic bought.</p>
    <p>The party then ventures into the subterranea below the temple and finds an opening to what appeared to be a large corridor that had caved in near the entrance. The party found a small tunnel (around the size of an ventilation duct) that they could just about crawl through (barely for Varic and Orthon). The tunnel let into a sewer that was only wide enough for single file. At either end of the sewer there were grates. Varic and Hieronymus went towards one and Tieron and Artiti went towards the other, with Orthon still on the other side of the small tunnel.</p>
    <p>When Varic reached the grate, 4 giant rats jumped out at him. Varic drew his glaive and went to town on them. Hieronymus tried to help with some darts but managed to instead hit Varic and completely miss. It had not been Hieron’s day. The rest of the party moved towards the commotion but due to the small space couldn’t assist Varic. Fortunately, he didn’t need it and slaughtered all four of the rats with his glaive that was burning with a blue flame. Unfortunately, both Varic and Hieron had got bitten by the giant rats.</p>
    <p>Now covered in shit and rat bites, the party found another small tunnel by the grate with the giant rats. They crawled through this tunnel and came out into what looked to be the continuation of the caved in corridor. There was a wooden door opposite the tunnel and further ahead the corridor turned left. Orthon had a look at Varic’s bite marks but he wasn’t showing any symptoms. Orthon gave him a potion of healing for the bites anyway.</p>
    <p>While the rest of the party was cleaning and/or healing up, Tieron started to peer round the turning. The corridor continued into an S bend, with a suit of steel plate armour standing at the end of the turning. Tieron started to walk towards it but triggered a trip wire, causing the armour to come to life and step towards him, sword drawn. Hearing the clattering footsteps of the armour, the rest of the party started to rush to Tieron.</p>
    <p>Tieron slows the armours movements by freezing its legs, and runs back to the corner to get out of it’s reach. The party rushes round the corner and each start smashing the armour to pieces. Hieron gets in first and throws his spear, but it misses and thunks into the wall beside the armour. Orthon then comes in and whacks it with his mace, followed up by Varic’s flaming glaive. Sparks start flying from Tieron’s hands as he grabs the armour - zapping it with his shocking grasp. While running to go grab his spear, Hieron whacks it twice with a kick and an elbow smack, though as it’s against plate armour, it doesn’t really do much…</p>
    <p>Artiti finishes the armour off with a satisfying critical smash to the helmet, ripping it off the rest of the armour and pinning the helmet to the wall behind. The armour clatters to the ground and the sword it was wielding falls out of its hands. Now that it isn’t being swung at them, the party notices that it seems to be decorated with runes of some kind. Tieron picks it up to inspect further, but the sword flies out of his hand and slashes at him. The sword then starts floating in front of the party, as if it was wielded by an invisible warrior.</p>
    <p>Orthon and Varic swing at the sword, breaking off the tip of the sword. Tieron - pissed at getting slashed at by this sword - shoots a ball of lightning into the sword, breaking it in half. Artiti throws some shit from the sewer in the area where the ‘invisible warrior’ would be, but it just flies straight through. Hieron runs at the sword and attempts to jump onto it, but the sword dodges out of the way. Orthon and Varic finish of the sword with their swings, breaking the last bit into pieces.</p>
    <p>Now that the armour was defeated, Hieron peered round the corner to the rest of the corridor. He was greeted by a crossbow bolt flying past his head. Hieron dashed back, when a surprisingly high class sounding dwarf shouted “Piss off!”. Artiti snuck up to the corner and used a small mirror to peer round the corner. Round it he saw 6 figures of many races, that had barricaded themselves with upturned tables. 5 of the men wielded crossbows, while the 6th was a well dressed dwarf who stood behind them. Hearing this, Varic stated to the group; “We are only here for the black glass, return it and there won’t be any trouble.” The dwarf responded with; “You take one step round this corner and you’re a gonna, so piss off!” To this, Varic looks at the party, picks up the chest plate of the recently smashed armour and notions to Artiti to prepare an arrow.</p>
    <p>Varic runs at full pelt towards the other side of the corridor and makes a leap to jump into cover on the other side, all while holding up the chest plate as a shield. The enemy group - shocked by this giant man jumping in front of them - instinctively loose arrows in his general direction, not prepared for this sudden appearance. Artiti responds with a deadly shot towards the dwarf in the backline, landing an arrow right between his eyes, instantly killing the dwarf. Varic sees this mid jump and smiles.</p>
    <div class='bold'><p>An arrow thunks into Varics head.</p></div>
    <p>Two more follow, getting through the gaps in the chest plate. Varic hits the ground and slides behind the cover he was aiming for - his body is limp. The party is enraged. Hieron rushes round the corner spear at the ready. The enemy are all busy trying to reload their crossbows. Hieron runs into the middle of them and jumps, stabbing one with his spear and kicking another in the face. Tieron comes round the corner and launches an electrified Chromatic orb at another, killing him. Artiti knocks another arrow and launches it into the head of another, killing him outright. Orthon runs forward and stops in front of two of them, before releasing his acid breath into two of the unready foes.</p>
    <p>With their leader and two others dead, the enemy start to panic, and try to draw their swords to defend themselves, but Hieron and Tieron were ready, with Hieron landing two heavy punches, finishing him off. Tieron casts a ray of frost to freeze an already acid burned half-elf to death. The last enemy, terrified by this show of dominance drops his sword and surrenders.</p>
    <p>Orthon runs over to Varics limp body and casts lay on hands, bringing him back from the brink of death. Varic slowly opens one eye, but finds that he can’t open the other. The arrow that hit him in the head destroyed his left eye. Belrim owes him big time for this one.</p>
    <p>The last survivor of the group is tied up while the area is searched. While searching the well dressed dwarf, a coin pouch is found. Varic opens the pouch to find 10 GP, and a small square piece of black glass. The others in the group question the survivor, who tells them that the well dressed dwarf was Perin, and that he had led them here to try and open up the door at the end of the corridor. At the end of the corridor, the was a large stone wall with intricate patterns and runes covering it, and a small slot in the middle.</p>
    <p>Varic takes the black glass out of the pouch and electricity starts to spread across the black glass from Varic’s fingers. This shocks the survivor, exclaiming “How did you do that?!” Varic ignores him and walks towards the stone wall. He inserts the black glass into the slot in the wall. The patterns and ruins start to glow and a thin opening starts to appear in the wall stretching from the ceiling to the floor along the line of the glass. This opening expands out more, opening the door to the area behind. Varic takes the glass square from the door.</p>
    <p>The area revealed to the party was the inside of a huge dome made entirely of black glass. The dome was around 100 foot in diameter and appeared to be impossibly perfect. In the center of this dome was another small dome (roughly 3 foot across), also made of black glass. The party enter the room and start inspecting the area. Varic walks towards the center dome and notices a handprint on it. Upon placing his hand there, the same electricity that spread across the black glass square starts to spread from Varic’s hand. The electricity also starts to spread from the feet of the rest of the party, slowly growing in size and brightness.</p>
    <p>Varic takes his hand away from the dome but the electricity still spreads from the handprint and everyone’s feet. It grows larger and brighter still, starting to spread up the walls/ceiling of the large dome. The party starts to back away when suddenly images start flashing up on the walls/ceiling of seemingly random scenes. Pictures of people growing older, talking, sleeping and eating. Scenes of children playing, men at work and of people dying. All of these images are flashing by too quick for anyone to take in - just about grasping the contents but no real detail.</p>
    <p>As the party are overwhelmed and confused by this sudden turn of events, something even stranger happens. Multiple godly voices start talking in unison inside of each party members head;</p>
    <div class='note'><p>Fate has chosen her daughters and sons</p>
    <p>and all but they her mercy shuns</p>
    <p>We stole the souls of half our subjects</p>
    <p>For the cycle ever twice that collects</p>
    <p>Within five Relics that power is stored</p>
    <p>Scattered in the wake of a shattered accord</p>
    <p>Betrayer, patriarch, the decaying king</p>
    <p>Against him, our relics, you must bring</p>
    <p>At the end of time lies your last stand</p>
    <p>For only you can save this land.</p></div>
    <p>As soon as the last words are spoken, a large crack appears in the ceiling above and gallons of water gush out. The door the party had come through starts to close. As the party makes to back out the room, a giant blob of water splashes down and start to rise up into a humanoid form, towering over the party at almost 15 foot tall. As the party make for the door, Orthon tries to hold the door open to make sure his companions make it through, but the force of it closing is to much for him. Although the water was getting to ankle height, the party manage to get out of the room before the door closes on the water elemental.</p>
    <p>Varic grabs the tied up survivor while the party makes for the tunnels they had originally came from. Although the door was closed, water was still leaking out of it and slowly spreading through the rest of the corridor. When the party reached the tunnel, they saw that the sewer water that once was only at ankle height, now had raised so much that the small tunnel was partially submerged, and the water was flowing by too quick to even attempt to fight.</p>
    <p>Running out of options, the party went through the wooden door opposite the small tunnel to come into a dirt tunnel with a small opening with light trickling down from above. In the center of the opening was a half buried skeleton with a raised hand, upon which was a gleaming gold ring. As Varic approached the skeleton, a mound of dirt raised up in front of him, from which a sound of vomited gravel (try to imagine that) verberated. Oddly enough, Tieron understood these sounds and could speak them himself.</p>
    <p>Tieron realised the mud mound was a mud mephit, who had said “Oi, hands off me treasure!” Tieron responded very eloquently with “I’m most sorry, we didn't mean to disturb you and we have no intention of taking your treasure. We merely wish to escape this place.” The mud mephit responded with; “Well, a’ight then, but if I see any yous going near our treasure, that’d be it for you lot, got it?”</p>
    <p>With the situation under control, the party looks up to the light source to see that there was an opening with a steel runged ladder protruding from the bottom. The bottom of the ladder however, was over 20 foot in the air. Varic put the tied up survivor down, and got in position to give someone a foot hold that he could help launch them up. Hieron, back up, then made a running jump at Varic, who launched him up and into the reach of the ladder. He Climbed up, tied a rope to the ladder and threw the end down to the party. As everyone climbed out of the pit, they looked around to discover they had just come out the well in someone’s garden...</p>`

    name: "Session 2",
    date: "12th August 2018",
    party: ["Artiti Baumk", "Hieronymus Botch", "Oriande Mallorn", "Orthon Anatole", "Shay Coulltree", "Tieron Malathrar", "Varic"],
    location: "A dude's garden in Marisberg",
    author: "Zac",
    content: `<p>We begin the session with the party dragging themselves out of the well and into the chill night air of an overgrown garden nestled behind an equally disused manor house.  Covered in blood and human waste the group trudged through the streets (attracting a few looks from guards and civilians alike) towards the museum of Corollas Bagridden. Along the way Varic and Orthon made a quick detour to the temple district and left the unconscious and freshly castrated (via foot) thug on the temple steps before returning to the group.</p>
    <p>Upon arrival at the small museum the party found the door ajar and heard voices from within. The group made their way down the house steps to the museum proper and saw a small gnomish woman, with jet black hair tied up in a neat pony tail and neat yet functional clothes, in an intense academic discussion with Corollas about the history of the old civilisations and prophecies. The party were both quite a sight and smell. After brief questioning Corollas assured the party that Shay (played by Rachel) could be trusted and was an academic friend from the small social circle of those interested in the history of this relatively young world.</p>
    <p>Varic presented the black glass artefact to Corollas without saying anything. Corollas was taken aback and revealed that truthfully he did not expect the party to succeed in their task. He pressed the party for details and Tieron and Orthon recounted the exploration of the sewers and the encounter with Perrin. When asked about his eye, Varic conceded that there were some confrontations with both Perrin’s men and the triplets working for Nellis. He reassured Corollas that his troubles with the gang were likely through.</p>
    <p>The party went on to explain to Corollas the events in the ruins, the strange properties of the black glass artefact and the domed chamber in which the party experienced the visions. Upon Orthon mentioning the words he heard in his head whilst in the domed chamer the group began to realise that they had all heard the same thing. Slowly, Hieronymus began to recount the words of the prophecy and the whole group joined in in reading the prophecy aloud. To the groups’ surprise, Shay joined in too.</p>
    <p>Corollas is surprised and excited. “That’s impossible. One of the most well known features of black glass is that it can’t be enchanted by any modern means. This must be looked into further.”</p>
    <p>Although Corollas was low on gold he rewarded the group with an enchanted key (1/20 chance to open any lock then breaks on success) and an eyepatch for Varic who begrudgingly accepted it. Corollas then pointed the party towards the Shade Wood as that was the origin of the black glass square the party had returned to him. This is no short treck and will be fraught with danger during the winter months. Despite this, all members of the party were keen to discover more about what this prophecy had in store for them and almost felt a pull leading them towards greater things. Shay stated that she was not to be left behind and would be coming too, provided the party took a bath.</p>
    <p>Whilst the rest of the group were scrubbing themselves in the sea, Tieron began asking around the docks in the hope of obtaining a vessel to take the group to the mainland. He discovered that only fishing vessels are venturing into the open waters from Marisberg at this time. Winter has started to take a hold of the continent and all those not protected by Oynel (god of farming and fishing) risk the wrath of Aver and Nepteri (earth gods of the wind and seas). He does however hear rumours of a specific vessel still making the short run from the town of Mondalton to Bucliff on the mainland. Tieron meets with the party over drinks and informs them of this and that we should leave in the morning in order to catch the ship before it too stops making the journey for the winter.</p>
    <p>The party enjoy some well-earned downtime, and some ran a few errands. Varic met with Gidor Firestout, his boss and owner of the tavern complex in Marisberg, and explained that he must leave but left him 20 gold in exchange for all the good will that Gidor had shown him during his stay. Varic also asked about the whereabouts of his good friend Belrim Bennar and discovered that he had left early the previous day muttering some nonsense about words in his dreams. The bar staff had assumed him drunk.</p>
    <p>Hieronymus used his new coinage to enjoy an evening in the finest bath house in the city and soak his weary body. Orthon spent some time in the temple of Uxen seeking guidance on his current path but his patron remained silent. Shay used the evening rest to start pouring through tomes from the Marisberg library that had any information on the Shade Wood, prophecies and the use of black glass by the old civilisation.</p>
    <p>The party set off in the morning led by Artiti as he had hunted in the woods and grassland surrounding Marisberg for many years and new best how to avoid the dangers that stalked the land. Despite the best efforts of Artiti to use the safer paths the party were ambushed by a seven-strong raiding party of Orcs whilst skirting a plain of shoulder height grass. The orcs were dressed in crude camouflage and wielded brutish greataxes and javelins. Hieronymus was quick into the fray and quickly felled one orc with a thrust of his spear followed by a flying knee. Shay, excited by her first ever taste of action, drew a bead on one of the brutes flanking the isolated monk and sent a bolt through the back of the creature’s head. She didn’t even see the orc hit the floor as in a flash she had dived into the cover of the long grass. The combat progressed in the party’s favour with Varic and Orthon wading in to engage with the remaining orc stupid enough to engage the party up close, Tieron putting and orc into a deep sleep and Artiti and Shay trading fire with the remaining orcs hurling javelins from the backlines.</p>
    <p>Hieronymus sensed a rout and charged the remaining cluster of orcs managing to land a few crunching strikes before being lifted off his feet by an arcing blow that sent him spiralling through the air and landing unconscious in the grass. Emboldened by seeing their party member fall the group charged forward, Varic’s flaming glaive carved one of the remaining orcs from shoulder to hip in a spray of sizzling blood and yet another of Shay’s bolts found it’s mark with a resounding thud. Before Orthon could rush to Hieronymus’ aid the Monk sprang up from the floor, bloodied and ragged but alive. Varic finished off the sleeping orc and silence fell once more.</p>
    <p>After tending to the monk’s wounds the party continued on and, through Artiti’s guidance, made good time to Mondalton. The town was sparsely populated to say the least and consisted of a small wooden palisade leading onto a cluster of small houses, a meagre looking tavern and a dock that, at the moment, contained a single ship with no sails.  The party piled into the small tavern and met the barkeep, a dwarf named Aggy (regarded by the group as a top bloke), and a slightly awkward young man who just wanted to read his book. Upon being pressed by Shay he revealed his name to be Oriande (played by Phoebe) and he was travelling on the ship in the morning.</p>
    <p>Tieron approached the ship’s captain who was busy tinkering and asked for passage on the vessel in the morning. His name was revealed to be Egridian, the captain of the only one-man ship in the world. Egridian was amazed by Tieron’s mariner past and agreed to let the party travel on the ship for free (man-crush). With their passage secured the party settled down for a long rest after a few drinks.</p>
    <p>The party made good time in the morning and met Egridian in the process of a few final checks on his vessel. The man then sealed himself in the captains cabin, grasped two strange orbs and glazed over. The ship very rapidly picked up speed and was soon travelling at a mighty speed through the waves. The party would have surely been thrown overboard by the motion of the vessel but somehow their boots felt surely planted on the deck. Egridian owns a magic boat.</p>
    <p>The first couple of hours passed with most of the party enjoying the sea breeze and the salt spray. Shay skipped from railing to railing in her excitement and even Oriande relaxed around the new faces a little to take in the rolling waves. Orthon however really did not enjoy the experience and the heavily armoured dragonborn spent a large portion of his time hanging over the rail and reacquainting himself with his breakfast.</p>
    <p>As time passed, Tieron began to notice a storm brewing in the ship’s path and called to Egridian warning him. Egridian advised holding onto something as things were going to get rough. Rain began to lash down and, even with the magic holding the ship relatively steady, the ride became notably rougher.</p>
    <p>A few minutes passed of this before Varic became aware of shapes moving alongside the boat in the water. He barely had time to shout a warning to the group and run his hand along the blade of his glaive before 10 merfolk exploded out of the water and started to drag themselves over the rails of the ship. The party started to convene in centre of the deck in a defensive formation before a large scaled creature dragged itself onto the decking beside Orthon. It wielded a wicked looking trident with coils of rope tied to one end and bared rows of needle-like teeth.</p>
    <p>Carnage broke out. Hieronymus was a dervish of fists and steel, Tieron sent a ball of crackling electricity into a nearby merfolk before bringing his arm quickly up to summon a wall of force to shatter three javelins destined for his chest and Oriande radiated invigorating holy energy before sending bolts of pure white flame hurtling at the assailants. Shay took cover behind a barrel and took pot shots at anything that moved and Artiti, seeing a group of merfolk rushing the cleric, muttered a few words and loosed an arrow that embedded itself in a merfolk’s chest before detonating in a hail of thorns and chunks of flesh. No sooner had Artiti lowered his bow the wind was taken out of him as the huge trident buried itself into his shoulder. He had no chance to cry out before he was dragged across the slippery decking and into the grasp of the huge scaled creature (a merrow). The party could only look on in horror as the creature bit down and tore a huge gash out of the left side of Artiti’s face and neck. Artiti crumbled to the floor, his ravaged face making the deck slick with blood.</p>
    <p>Orthon, upon seeing his comrade fall, raised his hammer to the sky and, with a prayer to Uxen, brought it down upon the creature’s flank. The ship shook with the sound of a thunderclap and the creature was thrown to the deck under the immense force of the blow yet somehow it began to coil and regain its posture. As it began to prepare a strike at Orthon that he planted his feet to take upon his shield, a bolt tore through it’s eye and stopped it mid-lunge. Shay darted behind the barrel again before Orthon could thank her.</p>
    <p>With the merrow fallen, the party made short work of the remaining merfolk and Oriande rushed over to aid Artiti. With a word of prayer to Pandrel as he cradled the rangers head the wounds on Artiti began to glow and knit back together. Coughing, Artiti regained consciousness and staggered to his feet away from the cleric. Touching the side of his face, he ran a finger across the scarred tissue that now remained where his ear used to be.</p>
    <p>Looting the corpses yielded a magical trident from the merrow which Varic handed to the sorcerer as he seemed the one most attuned to the sea.</p>
    <p>With the battle behind them the party looked to the horizon, and saw the outlines of buildings in the distance. Bucliff awaits.</p>

    <p>We explored upstairs and saw nothing</p>

    <p class='note '>“…building the statue’s foundation, the boys found some sort of hollow beneath the earth. There’s some sort of shrine inside.

We’re looking into…”</p>

    <p>We clicked 4 different torches and the statue plinth had moved to reveal a dark passageway down</p>

    <p>When we went through the dark passage we met two skeletal bodies standing in front of a large marble plinth with four black glass stalagmites that seemed to have erupted from the ground</p>

    <p>The skellingtons instantly charged at us and we set one on fire and smashed the second</p>

    <p>Once we beat them we noticed a skeletons body with a skull resting in its lap.</p>
    <p>The skull had a glove in its mouth and appeared to be making muffled sounds.</p>
    <p>The skeleton then started talking to us, and once its skull was put on the rest of its body, he started to walk around and talk to us.</p>

    <p>We have a skeleton butler named Belmont who has a brilliant voice/personality</p>

    <p>Belmont kept on talking about sending off a letter to the king about a guild, and said that this place was built for a guild.</p>
    <p>He had been there for 6 years and doesn’t remember anything other than waiting down there.</p>

    content: `<p>We were asked to hunt a paladin of Entex called Bartlett.</p>
    <p>We get 30 gold + anything non-sentimental on him.</p>
    <p>We asked around and heard about a suspicious hooded fellow in town a few days ago. He was trying to sell a golden fish amulet - a farmer called Bailey had one.</p>
    <p>To lure out the suspicous guy, we decided that Belrim will pretend to be selling something and try to barter with him.</p>
    <p>Surprisingly enough, it worked (sort of).</p>
    <p>The suspicious guy showed up at the pub we were waiting in. Belrim made it very obvious he hadn’t done anything like this and the guy tried to leave. The group pushed him into an alley by the pub.</p>
    <p>The group started to threaten the suspicious guy to get him to tell them where Bartlett was hiding out, but he wouldn’t tell them anything.</p>
    <p>Orthon channeled Uxen’s divinity to help persuade the suspicious guy to cooporate on the grounds that he wouldn’t let the others harm him. The guy agreed telling the group that Bartlett was at an old farm house just outside of town.</p>
    <p>After telling the group this, Orthon let the man go, who quickly took off running - making Artiti ready an arrow to shoot him down, though Orthon grabbed the bow out of Artiti’s hands before he could make the shot.</p>
    <p>The group headed over to the farm house, which they saw was sitting on a hill as a form of natural protection from both the elements and the beings that are sent by the Gods of the Earth.</p>
    <p>Eldaril turned herself into a spider and scouted out the house - it seemed to be all clear, but the house itself had been burned down.</p>
    <p>By the house was the symbol of Oynel (God of farming & fishing) that had been formed in the traditional way by burning the ground and letting a natural fungus grow to create the symbol.</p>
    <p>While some of the group were investigating the burned house, a guy came along the path and spotted some of the group and took off running in the opposite direction. The party followed after him - leading them to a clearing with a set of tents, and a fully armoured man riding attop a large black warhorse was waiting for them.</p>
    <p>Roll for initiative.</p>
    <p>The group soon surrounded Bartlett, with both Varic and Eldarils bear forms flanking him, he was swiftly struck down, but not before knocking Orthon down with a critical blow.</p>
    <p>While the rest of the group was surrounding Bartlett, Hieronymus was running back and forth between the other 3 men who were part of Bartlett’s gang, grabbing their arrows and throwinbg them back at them, or just generally pummeling one guy who was trying to run.</p>
    <p>Artiti got the final shot on Bartlett, but made sure that it wasn’t a leathal blow.</p>
    <p>On his knees, Bartlett begged for his life to be taken, as he had no worth going back to the town for trial, pleading that he would just be hanged. He was a paladin of Entex, and so should be struck down by a blade not by a rope.</p>
    <p>The group accepted and asked who he wishes to be killed by, he says Orthon. Tieron hands Orthon his knife. Orthon Picks up Bartlett, pulling him allong towards to wooded area. He tells the rest of the group not to follow him.</p>
    <p>Orthon leads Bartlett to a clearing in the woods. He heals Bartlett for 5 point with lay on hands then hands him his mace.</p>
    <p>“This is your chance to either die by my blade, or prove you are worthy to continue on.” Orthon says while drawing his silver sword.</p>
    <p>Bartlett strikes before Orthon, his first hit bouncing off his shield, but his second hit lands, hard.</p>
    <p>Orthon falls to his knees. Bartlett grabs his neck and says; “Does your oath require you to die by my blade?”</p>
    <p>“It is your choice to make.”</p>
    <p>Bartlett drops Orthon - his body collapsing to the ground, blood slowly pouring out the wound in his head.</p>
    <p>As Orthon falls unconcious, Bartlett says; “That was the most honour that anyone has ever shown me. For that, I will not take your life this day.”</p>
    <p>Bartlett drops tha mace by Orthon, and takes his silver sword and attaches it to his belt. As he turns away, he says; “I shall try to do better this time.”</p>
    <br/>
    <p>While this was happening, the rest of the group interegated the other members of Bartlett’s gang, finding out that he stored 30gp by one of the tents, which Belrim swiftly found.</p>
    <p>About 20 minutes later, Orthon limps out of the woods and hands Tieron back his knife, saying that Bartlett is delt with.</p>
    <p>After hearing that Bartlett had about 100gp stored away somewhere, Eldaril remembered a grave that was by the farmers house - unusual as most bodies tend to be cremated. When the group goes to investigate the grave, they find the 100gp, as well as a cursed Glaive that Varic takes, and a longbow that Eldaril takes.</p>`

    <p>Arena rules – 6 rounds. We need to win 5 to get the money (1000 gold). 6th round is the lethal one, and if you win you get the black glass helmet. Two rounds, short rest, two rounds, short rest, 5th round, sleep for a night if you decide to go for round 6. If we perform well, then we can win the crowd and get extra help. We are allowed to kill the creatures that are after us, just as they are allowed to try and kill us.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>In town</span></p>
    <p>Allard and Nana’s Armour and Shields – male halfling Allard works there. He makes all the armour. We got Orthon full plate armour, but it’s a loan. The shield will be kept if we win, and it has the emblem of Allard’s shop on it. Allard also gets 150 gold of our winnings if we survive.</p>
    <p>The Fox’s Tinctures – potion shop. Female gnome shopkeeper. Got 3 healing potions for 5 of Eldaril’s herbs and 50 gold. Artiti tried to take 4. It did not work.</p>
    <p>The Bloody Sword – the inn. Dwarf fighter is Ketty Omlinson(?)</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Before the fights</span></p>
    <p>Antiochus – master and presenter at the arena. Burly human man, fancy dressed. Gives us another run down of the rules.</p>
    <p>The arena is a sandy floor. Sandstone ruins dotted around. We’ve attracted a big crowd; the largest crowd we’ve ever seen, 60k people watching.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Round 1 – Minotaurs</span></p>
    <p>Planned strategy: Hieronymous distracts one of the minotaurs using his movement whilst the rest of us take down the other one. Then we can gang up on the second.</p>
    <ul class=''><li>Varic transforms into his bear form before the battle starts.</li>
    <li>Two hulking minotaurs, Gop and Tak, enter.</li>
    <li>Artiti uses sharpshooter and does 15 damage to Tak.</li>
    <li>Gop charges at Hieronymous. His horns slam into his chest, doing 17 damage to H.</li>
    <li>Varic charges at Tak, lighting his glaive on fire and does 10 damage to him. It doesn’t get any reaction other than anger.</li>
    <li>Oriande backs up Varic, using sacred flame on Tak, doing 5 damage.</li>
    <li>Eldaril shoots at Tak, but her arrow glances off of his armour.</li>
    <li>Tak strikes Varic. Minotaurs roll 2 d12s, apparently. So, he does 15 slashing damage.</li>
    <li>Orthon chooses to back up Hieronymous, challenging Gop to distract him from the injured monk. 11 slashing damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous takes advantage of the distraction to strike at Gop. His spear strike glances off of the minotaur’s armour, but his punch to the minotaur’s nose does 5 damage. He disengages and backs away, putting distance between himself and the thing that can definitely kill him.</li>
    <li>Shay broke away from the group, using the distance to fire her crossbow at Tak. It does 12 damage. He’s winded by the blow, so she opts to shoot again, doing a further 9 damage, and bonus action hides.</li>
    <li>Artiti shoots at Tak again, using his colossus slayer ability to do even more damage. His arrow does 23 damage to the minotaur, slamming into his chest and manages to go through. Tak is not looking very good now.</li>
    <li>Gop swings at Orthon, but his great axe bounces off the shield. Orthon shouts “It’s ya boi” much to Allard’s delight, who watches in the crowd.</li>
    <li>Varic strikes Tak with his glaive, but the blade glances off of his armour. Luckily, Varic manages to swing the end of his glaive, striking the minotaur in the head so hard that he drops instantly. He’s not dead yet, but he’s definitely bleeding out. Varic raises his glaive in a warrior’s salute to the crowd.</li>
    <li>Oriande, seeing Tak drop, spins to help Orthon, casting sacred flame on Gop.</li>
    <li>Eldaril backs up, giving herself enough distance between herself and Gop to shoot at him. She changes into a direwolf.</li>
    <li>Orthon taunts Gop.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous dashes in, crossing about 100ft in 0.3 seconds by Naruto running. He goes for a flying kick, but he actually overshoots and misses.</li>
    <li>Shay moves closer to Eldaril to give herself a clear line of sight, and shoots at Gop, doing 17 damage. As she was successful, she shoots again, doing another 7 damage. She ducks behind cover again. Bonus action hide.</li>
    <li>Artiti utilises his sharpshooter skills, but he doesn’t have a clear line of sight, so he misses. He ducks behind cover.</li>
    <li>Gop is furious, engaging his reckless ability. He charges at Varic, seeking revenge. Orthon tries to stop him, dealing xx damage with his sword. Varic manages to lower his glaive, so Gop’s momentum impales him on the weapon, doing 25 points of damage. Gop is close enough to try and do some damage to Varic, dealing 25 damage.</li>
    <li>Varic braces the horns, managing to pull Gop away from himself. He swings at Gop, his glaive carving diagonally across Gop’s chest. It sinks into his shoulder, stopping at his sternum, and Gop goes down.</li>
    <li>The crowd goes absolutely mental.</li></ul>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Round 2 – Cockatrices</span></p>
    <p>Planned strategy: They will try to turn us to stone? Basically, avoid letting that happen. They’re going to use mob tactics, most likely.</p>
    <ul class=''><li>8 cockatrices enter the arena. Violent chickens. Two of them sprint towards the group, each taking a bite at Orthon and Eldaril. Both of them miss.</li>
    <li>Eldaril is still a direwolf, and as she has Orthon at her side and Oriande behind her, she uses pack tactics to attack the cockatrice. She chomps the cockatrice, dealing 11 piercing damage to the beast. Wounded, it’s now prone.</li>
    <li>Oriande supports Eldaril by using sacred flame, doing 4 damage to the injured cockatrice, singing the already bloodied creature.</li>
    <li>Varic peels away from the group, striking at one of the cockatrices. He does damage, and the cockatrice is badly bloodied.</li>
    <li>Shay sprints towards one of the ruins, managing to climb to the top. She’s now safely out of reach of the cockatrices on the ground and has a good vantage point. She takes a shot at the cockatrice closest to her, doing 7 points of damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous sprints over to the prone beastie, using his spear to do 11 damage to it, killing it instantly. He sidesteps, dealing a flurry of blows to the cockatrice beside it. Only one of his strikes really connects, dealing 5 damage, but he does manage to elbow slam the chicken to the ground. Despite his best efforts, it bounces back up. Hieronymous chooses to get some distance, surveying the scene.</li>
    <li>The cockatrice that Shay shot at rushes over to her wall, trying to attack her. Luckily, it can’t reach her.</li>
    <li>Another cockatrice flies straight for Oriande, but he manages to keep it back with his shield.</li>
    <li>Varic sees a cockatrice flying at him and hits it so hard it flies into the crowd. For a second, they’re shocked, but then cheer about their unexpected trophy.</li>
    <li>The cockatrice beside it lunges for Varic and tries to bite him. Its teeth connect, making Varic’s joints stiffen for a second, but he manages to shake it off and recovers quickly.</li>
    <li>Artiti uses his sharpshooter skills to fire at a cockatrice, doing 15 damage.</li>
    <li>In response to the threat, two of the cockatrices charge Artiti. Their fangs connect, and Artiti is petrified. He begins to turn to stone, retraining him. He’s starting to lock up.</li>
    <li>A cockatrice tries to bite Eldaril, but it misses.</li>
    <li>Orthon attacks the chicken that got punched by Hieronymous, doing damage.</li>
    <li>The last cockatrice tries to bite Orthon, but misses.</li>
    <li>Eldaril tries to fight back, but unfortunately doesn’t manage to connect.</li>
    <li>Oriande uses sacred flame on the cockatrice Orthon has injured. He cooks the chicken, but it’s still just about standing.</li>
    <li>Varic’s turn</li>
    <li>Shay shoots at the cockatrice trying to bite her. Her crossbow bolt pins it to the earth, killing it. She shoots again at the cockatrice Oriande set on fire, but unfortunately misses.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous vaults over the injured cockatrice, slamming the second with a flurry of blows. He deals 13 damage, and shoves it back towards Varic. As it flies towards him, Varic swings his glaive, dealing 12 points of damage and bats it out of the arena.</li>
    <li>Artiti is still restrained, trying to escape the petrifying effects of the bite. He uses his fading strength to deal 13 damage, killing it instantly. He tries to break free from the effects but can’t. He turns to stone.</li>
    <li>A cockatrice tries to bite at Oriande, but he bats it away with his shield.</li>
    <li>Orthon strikes the cockatrice nearest to him, killing it. His sword splits it in two.</li>
    <li>The crowd are loving it and throw a coin purse to Varic for his excellent golf swing.</li>
    <li>Eldaril lunges for the last cockatrice left, doing</li>
    <li>Oriande sets fire to the last cockatrice remaining, doing 2 points of radiant damage. You can smell cooked meat.</li>
    <li>Varic, enraged by seeing Artiti turn to stone, runs forwards to do 27 damage. He absolutely minces it. It is definitely dead.</li>
    <li>We have won both rounds, so now we get a short rest, but Artiti has been turned to stone for 24 hours.</li></ul>
    <p>We leave the arena, carrying Artiti with us. We decide to leave him in the quarters, because there’s no point in dragging him into a battle. Without wish or greater restoration, we cannot turn him back, and have to wait it out.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Round 3 – Spined devil and three shapechangers</span></p>
    <p>Planned strategy: Uh... kill it quickly?</p>
    <ul class=''><li>Varic bears up before the battle begins.</li>
    <li>Three men with staves plant them into the ground, spilling smoke over the arena. A spined devil appears from the shroud. Three shapechangers stand before it. They’ve taken bat form.</li>
    <li>Varic steps forwards, striking one of the bats with his glaive. He does xx damage, killing it instantly. He swings towards the second, doing 7 points of damage on it. He steps back again, putting distance between himself and the creatures.</li>
    <li>The spined devil curls his sharp tail, whipping two spines towards Varic. The first spine does 6 piercing damage, and 4 fire damage. But the second doesn’t do as much harm. Varic takes a total of 10 points of damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous charges forwards, striking out with his spear. The jab impales the bat, killing it. He does 5 points of bludgeoning damage to the third bat and backs up quickly to gain ground.</li>
    <li>The bat he just punched speaks to him in abyssal, telling him “Your end is near.” Hieronymous is frightened by the bat, and has disadvantage for as long as the bat is visible. The bat backs away, putting distance between itself and the group.</li>
    <li>Orthon rolls a goddamn natural 20. And he has a magic sword that eats fiends like the spined devil for breakfast. He rolls 42 damage and cuts off its tail. The spined devil is still alive, but it’s badly wounded.</li>
    <li>Shay leaps from cover to shoot at the spined devil, doing 17 points of piercing damage. It embeds in its wing, but it’s not dead yet. It’s looking rough though, so she shoots again, doing 8 points of piercing damage and kills it. It curls up like a spider and vanishes in a puff of smoke.</li>
    <li>Oriande engulfs the remaining bat with sacred flame, dealing 3 points of damage. It’s melting.</li>
    <li>Eldaril shoots at the bat but misses.</li>
    <li>Varic lunges for the bat, finishing it off by impaling it against the arena wall. It vanishes in a puff of smoke.</li>
    <li>The crowd aren’t pleased, it ended too quickly.</li></ul>
    <p>But the strategy was a success.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Round 4 – Chimera</span></p>
    <p>Planned strategy: DO NOT DIE.</p>
    <ul class=''><li>A fairly quick creature darts out of the tunnel. It first looks like a lion, but it has more heads. It’s a chimera, a mixture of scales and fur, a lion head, a dragon head, and a goat head.</li>
    <li>There’s no cover, so Shay moves to the side, preparing to shoot the chimera when someone else engages it.</li>
    <li>The chimera steps forwards, and the dragon head breathes fire on the group. 38 damage. Varic, Orthon, Hieronymous and Eldaril are immediately rendered unconscious. Oriande and Shay manage to avoid its breath.</li>
    <li>Shay sees this and shoots at the chimera. She deals 16 points of damage, which is enough to draw its attention. It moves towards her, and the ram’s head deals 10 damage to Shay.</li>
    <li>Oriande channels divinity; glowing with heavenly energy, he revives all those who are prone. They each regain 5 hp. Oriande heals Varic with 14 hp. Luckily, none of them are too severely injured, they haven’t lost limbs. He backs away from the chimera, making sure to keep his distance.</li>
    <li>Eldaril manages to get to her feet, summoning a flaming sphere and sending it towards the chimera. It does 9 damage. She changes into her bear form and is able to maintain her flaming sphere because of concentration.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous jumps up and decides to take a jab before he runs away. His spear does 5 damage, and he manages to get away from the chimera. As a bonus action he uses patient defence.</li>
    <li>Varic strikes the chimera with his glaive, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage. As the end of his glaive hits the ram’s head, knocking it out.</li>
    <li>Orthon gets up, charging forwards and slashes at it. He misses.</li>
    <li>Shay shoots at the chimera but misses.</li>
    <li>The chimera turns, breathing fire at Orthon and biting at Varic. It deals 5 damage to Varic. The flames knock Orthon unconscious, and he receives a minor injury; he breathes in the flame as it engulfs him, and he loses his voice for 2 days.</li>
    <li>Oriande casts sacred flame on the dragon head, dealing 5 damage. He then uses healing word on Orthon, healing him with 12 hp.</li>
    <li>Eldaril charges forwards in her bear form, dealing 12 piercing damage 11 slashing damage with her multi-attack. She backs off.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous flanks the chimera, striking it with his spear and then punching it twice, dealing 23 points of damage to it. The spear goes through the lion’s head, killing it. He takes a chance to knock it to the ground. The chimera is now prone. Hieronymous takes a step back to make sure he’s out of range.</li>
    <li>Varic lunges, dealing 9 points of slashing damage. He rolls a nat 20, dealing 12 points of bludgeoning damage. This definitely injures the dragon head.</li>
    <li>Orthon gets back on his feet for the second time. He’s pissed at the dragon, and though he wants to curse at it, he can’t speak. He swings, his blade dealing 12 points of slashing damage to the dragon head, cutting it clean off.</li>
    <li>The dragon’s head rolls to the floor. Orthon holds it up, and the crowd goes wild.</li></ul>
    <p>They all take a short rest. Everyone has been restored to health.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Round 5 – Ogres, goblins, orcs.</span></p>
    <ul class=''><li>The ogre enters, carrying a mace and a platform on his back. On this platform are four goblins. Another ogre enters, wielding a chain. Three figures enter, and they are orcs.</li>
    <li>The chain ogre charges forwards, swinging his chain above his head and bringing it crashing down on the group. Hieronymous is far away enough to not take damage. Oriande and Shay take 3 damage. Varic, Orthon and Eldaril are prone and take 6 damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous backs away, charging instead at one of the orcs. He deals 12 damage to the orc in two punches. He attempts to knock him prone, and the second hit connects, taking him to the ground. He retreats, putting distance between himself and the group of orcs.</li>
    <li>Shay disengages, backing away so she has enough distance to shoot. She deals 19 points of damage to the chain ogre.</li>
    <li>Varic gets back to his feet, dealing 14 slashing damage to the ogre.</li>
    <li>Oriande has had enough of watching his friends get hurt, so he uses guiding bolt against the chain brute. He rolls a nat 20 and deals 58 damage. Guiding bolt obliterates the brute, sending it hurtling back into the wall of the arena. It’s definitely dead.</li>
    <li>Orthon takes xx damage when the other ogre strikes him.</li>
    <li>The orc who was sent prone gets up and takes a swing at Hieronymous. The monk dodges.</li>
    <li>Orc 2 tries to attack Orthon, and Orc 3 tries to attack Varic. Both orcs miss.</li>
    <li>The goblins on top of the big ogre aim at Varic. Only one of them hits, dealing xx damage to Varic.</li>
    <li>Eldaril manages to get to her feet, and moves to flank the orc that tries to attack Varic. She performs a multi-attack, taking a bite out of it for 9 damage, but her slash misses it. The orc is looking injured.</li>
    <li>Orthon rises, and uses both smite and thunderous smite on the big ogre. Holy energy strikes the arena, a thunder clap ringing through the air. He deals 24 damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous jabs with his spear at the orc attacking him, but it misses. He chooses to move and join the fray against the big ogre. He flanks it, and deals 4 damage. He tries to push the ogre over but doesn’t quite manage it.</li>
    <li>Shay shoots at the big ogre, and it’s looking very bloody.</li>
    <li>Varic strikes twice at the big ogre with his glaive. He deals 10 points of bludgeoning damage, and 2 points of fire damage. The ogre collapses, and as the platform on its back is destroyed. The goblins topple out of it.</li>
    <li>Oriande uses sacred flame on the orc behind Varic and Orthon. He kills it and moves on to smite one of the goblins with his spiritual weapon. It dies too.</li>
    <li>Orc’s turn, he attacks Hieronymous. Another orc takes out a javelin and tries to attack Oriande. He deflects it with his shield.</li>
    <li>Eldaril moves towards the orc that attacked Orthon. She deals 14 slashing damage to the orc, brining it down. The audience are slightly alarmed by the mauling by bear.</li>
    <li>Orthon is enraged that the orc tried to attack Oriande, so he charges and takes a swing at him. It kills him. Orthon is collecting heads today.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous lunges for the remaining goblins. He kicks one of them, dealing 7 damage. The blow connects with its head, killing it. He jabs another with his spear, dealing 5 points of damage, killing that one too.</li>
    <li>Shay shoots the last remaining goblin, killing it.</li></ul>
    <p>Antiochus asks if we will take the final challenge and try to win the crown. The crowd goes dead silence, waiting for our answer. We accept.</p>
    <p>We leave the arena to take our long rest.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline '>Round 6 – Gnar the Unbridled, the reigning champion.</span></p>
    <ul class=''><li>Giant, hulking red lizard creature stomps out into the arena. He has 50ft movement and 10ft reach. He towers above Orthon, and deals 36 damage, and Orthon is now unconscious, dangling from his mouth. It then swings its tail at Shay, dealing 14 damage.</li>
    <li>Eldaril summons a beam of lunar energy, and the moonbeam strikes the lizard. It deals 14 damage and surrounds it in ghostly fire.</li>
    <li>Oriande casts sacred flame on the lizard, 8 damage, and then uses healing word on Orthon to try and give him a chance to escape/live. He’s healed for 12 points.</li>
    <li>Shay disengages from the fight, and shoots at the lizard. She flees, putting distance between herself and the lizard.</li>
    <li>Varic moves in, swinging his glaive and does xx damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous uses step of the wind to increase his jump distance. He takes a running leap, landing on the lizard’s back. He manages to hold on, jabbing one handed with his spear. His attack deals 5 damage.</li>
    <li>The lizard immediately does a thunderous stomp, trying to knock everyone to the ground. Varic is the only one who goes prone.</li>
    <li>Orthon tries to escape from the lizard’s jaws, but doesn’t manage. He is still conscious.</li>
    <li>Gnar chomps down on Orthon again, knocking him unconscious again. He takes another tail swing at Varic, dealing 11 damage.</li>
    <li>The flames on the lizard’s back dissipate. Eldaril’s round.</li>
    <li>Oriande casts sacred flame on Gnar, dealing 8 damage. He then uses healing word and heals Varic for 14 points.</li>
    <li>Shay’s turn.</li>
    <li>Varic’s turn.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous is shaken off of Gnar’s back. He tries for a flurry of blows, but only one punch connects, dealing 5 damage.</li>
    <li>Orthon breathes acid fire down Gnar’s throat, dealing 4 damage.</li>
    <li>Gnar swings his tail, but both Oriande and Varic manage to dodge it.</li>
    <li>Gnar swings his tail again at Oriande. It deals 19 damage.</li>
    <li>Eldaril shoots at Gnar with her crossbow, but misses. She casts healing word on Oriande, giving him 7 health points back.</li>
    <li>Oriande moves around to Gnar’s side, shooting it with guiding bolt and dealing 18 damage.</li>
    <li>Shay shoots at Gnar, dealing a total of</li>
    <li>Varic deals 16 points of slashing damage, and 10 points of bludgeoning damage.</li>
    <li>Hieronymous slides towards Gnar, losing his footing and landing on his back. He manages to get up again, trying to attack again, but his two punches do not connect. He tries again with his spear, dealing 5 damage.</li>
    <li>Orthon tries to stab through Gnar’s head, utilising both smite and thunderous smite. He deals 33 damage. As soon as Gnar’s mouth opens, Orthon stands within its mouth, stabbing upwards. His sword pierces the roof of its mouth, and a thunderclap strikes the arena. The top of its head explodes, covering the first row and everyone in the battleground in t-rex brains. A spray of red mist has covered the sand. It’s definitely dead.</li>
    <li>The body falls on top of Hieronymous, who is still lying beneath it. It knocks him unconscious. Orthon points his sword at where Hieronymous is, and light shoots from the blade. Hieronymous is stabilised.</li></ul>
    <p>We pull Hieronymous back from underneath the t-rex, heal him up. The crowd have lost their minds, throwing coins and flowers into the arena. We feel like heroes. We get level 5.</p>`

    <p><span class='bold '>Character status:</span> Artiti was turned to stone for 24 hours. This effect should have lifted by this session, but his immune system is crap so now we need to drag his statue form around with us. One of his arms, up to his elbow, is returned to normal, but the rest is stone. Orthon had still lost his voice by the start of this session but regained it during this session.</p>

    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold '>At the arena</span></p>
    <p>Varic and Oriande drag Hieronymous out from under the dead lizard. Antiochus is now approaching us, is actually quite impressed by our success. Gives us a small chest, and a string of 100 platinum coins on a silk ribbon.</p>
    <p>He then asks who we want to take the black glass helmet. Varic shoves Oriande forwards, and Antiochus places the helmet on his head. Everyone cheers, and there’s a party planned to last a long time. Varic also plugs Allard’s armour because Orthon still has no voice.</p>
    <p>We leave the arena, returning to our quarters. The guardsman at the door is impressed, and lets us know that there’s been a guest waiting for us. We start to divide up the winnings between us, and we get 16 coins each, with one left over.</p>
    <p>Artiti is still a statue, but Oriande’s passive perception is 19 so he can see Artiti’s pinkie finger wriggling. He’s getting there, but his metabolism is terrible, so he’s not back yet.</p>
    <p>The guest is a thin man who’s got a dark grey beard, and long dark hair. Master Greyjen (?) He’s wearing a fancy robe. Says we’re overdue a teleport back to the city. Shay asks if we can still teleport Artiti, who is a statue, and he says yes.</p>
    <p>Master Greyjen gives Orthon a silver ring which allows telepathic communication, as Orthon can’t talk yet. Orthon asks who booked in our teleport, and Master Greyjen explains that one of the juniors did it, do the paperwork’s wrong. Orthon asks if he can return the armour first.</p>
    <p>Shay asks if we can delay our teleport back so that we can party a bit and rest, and Master Greyjen agrees on the condition that we tell him how a group of strange individuals came to fight in the arena.</p>
    <p>We go to Allard first, to return the armour we borrowed. Hieronymous asks Oriande if he can try on the helmet, and then Shay, whilst we’re walking to Allard’s. Varic stays at the back of the group, because he wants to keep an eye on Master Greyjen.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='italics '>MEANWHILE</span></p>
    <p>Tieron and Belrim are sort of by themselves at the moment, knowing that the rest of the group had gone to fight in the arena. Staying in an inn called the Limping Lamb, sharing a room.</p>
    <p>They set up their own travelling show whilst we were gone. They make ten gold on their first night of performing. Their band name is S Club 2. They get 5 gold on the next night and split their earnings separately. So they go to bed that night feeling pretty satisfied.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold '>At Allard’s</span></p>
    <p>Master Greyjen is in the mid of the group, but Varic is still at the back. Orthon opens the door to Allard’s, and he’s very happy to see us. “Get that armour off right now,” Allard says, very excited, because he’s got buyers lining up. Orthon does strip (he’s got vestments underneath), and Allard helps him. We did him a massive favour, so now he’s very grateful. He thought about letting Orthon keep the money, and then decides he’s not that good-hearted.</p>
    <p>Master Greyjen speaks on Orthon’s behalf; expresses Orthon’s gratitude and asks for more armour (splint(?) armour). Allard does actually have some armour ready for him, which he offers at the price of 200 gold. Master Greyjen manages to barter it down to 100 gold.</p>
    <p>Varic pulls Hieronymous to the side whilst Master Greyjen is talking to Allard, intending to talk to him privately. Master Greyjen does notice Varic doing that, but doesn’t react to it. Varic tells Hieronymous that he bears the mark of the wolf on the letter Shay received and the mark they discussed (related to Varic’s clan).</p>
    <p>Varic says he wants to see how Oriande and Shay handle their ale.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold '>Party time</span></p>
    <p>We all make our way to the beach, and we don’t pay for our drinks tonight. Those who rolled above 15 are a bit drunk but feeling good, anyone below is going to feel rough tomorrow. Meanwhile Eldaril is absolutely out of it, having rolled a 2. Master Greyjen is with us, and has only had one or two drinks, much like Oriande.</p>
    <p>Orthon is drunk, and goes up to Oriande. “Watch this.” He then uses Hold Person on Varic, and tackles him, so Varic has to bench press this dragon off of him once the spell wears off. Eldaril sees this happening and she wants to join in. She is hella drunk but somehow rolls a nat 20, so she casts Produce Flame but it’s HUGE. Getting this group drunk is apparently quite dangerous.</p>
    <p>Master Greyjen and Shay have been chatting whilst this chaos has been going on. She hasn’t told him the whole story yet, but she’s just talking about history and artefacts, and asks if he’s heard any updates about the unrest in the capital. He’s interested by the artefact thing before and says that he’s seen something similar crafted with black glass. He says he can’t remember much about it, but it’s far away and out of reach. Shay rolls 12 on her persuasion check, and he’s reluctant to expand on it anymore.</p>
    <p>Varic is still suspicious, but thinks Master Greyjen is telling the truth, even though he’s not talking about everything.</p>
    <p>Master Greyjen returns to questioning Shay, but she doesn’t want to tell him all about the prophecy. He sees she’s reluctant to talk, but doesn’t think she’s lying, and asks if she knows about the age of dwarves instead. There’s evidence that there were a lot more dwarves, who were more powerful and more organised, and even had mages. He’s particularly interested in plain(a? er?) travel (branch of teleportation?). Believes the warp nodes operate on the same mechanism. Shay asks about the tiara’s abilities and sees if they’re similar, but does it in a way so that Master Greyjen doesn’t know that we have it. “Hypothetically, could it lead to travelling to such linked realms?” Greyjen says it’s a bit iffy, doesn’t think it’s possible (to use the tiara to travel to the past).</p>
    <p>We fall asleep on the beach, and get a long rest from it. We wake up to a loud sound, and see a glowing circle with mist pouring out of it. We see two shadows moving out of it. One of them is stone Artiti, which Greyjen pushes through, and then asks if we want to go.</p>
    <p>Before we leave, Varic speaks. “Before we go anywhere with you, I want you to explain the rings. Wolf’s head is a symbol of King Wolfgard(?), which was given in honour of his service, the other is the sigil of a group of mages he sometimes assists. Varic turns to us and tells us about the rings.</p>
    <p>Shay asks if he can tell us more about King Wolfgard. Greyjen says Wolfgard was a good man, if a bit aggressive in his later years. Shay wants to know if he still has support within the people today. Most people accepted his son’s ascension.</p>
    <p>Greyjen teleports us.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='italics '>MEANWHILE</span></p>
    <p>S Club 2 wake up early in the morning, when the sun isn’t even up, because there’s a knock at the door. Tieron goes to answer it, and Belrim readies his axe. As Tieron goes to open it, the door bursts open, and two men in blue armour with gold trim enter, their hands on their sword hilts. These are clearly palace guards. Belrim drops his axe. A third man enters more slowly, less urgent, in steel armour. He’s very tall for a human, about 6’6”. He doesn’t wear a helmet, and he’s in his late 50s. Dark silver moustache and short beard but has a scarred face. Kingsguard.</p>
    <p>“Belrim Bennar, Tieron Malathrar, you will come with us.” Belrim’s upset this whole sentence doesn’t rhyme. Tieron wants to know why, but he’s not told. They both agree to go with the guards, who walk them through the city. They’re under some form of arrest, having to wear manacles, and are taken down into a dungeon. They are thrown into a cell and spend the day waiting, basically, with one guard. They’re both still manacled. Is this the end of S Club 2?!</p>
    <p>Four more guards come down, and ask for them to remove all their belongings and stand by the walls. It’s not the first time Belrim’s been arrested for drunk and disorderly, so they both comply, and spend the rest of the day pacing the cell, bored out of their minds. Suddenly, their cell is lit by a flash of purple light, which then quickly fades. They rush to the grate, and see a man in a grey robe.</p>
    <p>The group has been teleported into the cell opposite S Club 2’s.</p>
    <p>Greyjen says he’s sorry, but we’ve been accused of great crimes. Apparently something to do with Hitchem.</p>
    <p>Varic punches the door in frustration, but it doesn’t come down. He tells us that Greyjen bears the mark of the people responsible for the annihilation of Varic’s people but hadn’t attacked him up until now because he couldn’t tell if Greyjen was lying. Based on Varic’s description of the mark,</p>
    <p>Tieron knows (much like the rest of the group) know that the mark relates to the god of magic, but the spire at the bottom is unfamiliar.</p>
    <p>Before we can do anything else, six guards come down, standing between the two cell doors. We’re told to get rid of our belongings, basically everything but our clothes. They unlock the door, and all of our belongings are packed into a chest of holding.</p>
    <p>Character note: Now that we can see it, Varic’s entire torso and probably most of his body is covered with blue fire tattoos.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold '>In the morning</span></p>
    <p>Eleven guards come down to us, 5 to each door, whilst one stands in the middle. He’s got a big sort of trolley with him (the kind that carries heavy objects on it). We’ve been granted with permission to see the king, but we don’t fight them.</p>
    <p>We’re led up a set of steps, and find ourselves in a long rectangular room, definitely a throne room. It has gilded marble pillars, marble walls, and a domed glass ceiling. The floor is really fine marble tiles. Most people are sitting in fancy chairs, except for one figure wearing a golden crown embedded with sapphires. He’s got long dark hair, fair skin, green eyes, but he’s got slightly pointed ears. Not an elf, but a half elf. There’s throne to his left is empty, but to his right is a woman who is similar in appearance to the king. She’s wearing a gentleman’s doublet, sitting cross-legged, looking pretty bemused and grin when we come it. The man who arrested Tieron and Belrim is also present.</p>
    <p>Oriande, Belrim, and Tieron have spent some time in Elmond(?), and recognise King Embris and the woman, Princess Frissa, the king’s sister. Eldaril lives close, so she recognises them too, and though Shay doesn’t know who the beardy wizard is, she knows that the other guy is the Lord General Ashing.</p>
    <p>The guards step aside to let us enter, but the first guard approaches the king and presents the members of the guild operating as The Shards.</p>
    <p>The king asks us to state our business in Hitchem. Eldaril explains that we went there looking for a teleport, and that was it. The king says that’s strange, because we were the last people to leave Hitchem alive. The town has been destroyed. So now we need to explain.</p>
    <p>But we didn’t do anything, and the king is confused by our purpose, clearly doesn’t believe us. So Shay explains why we went to the arena, saying we’re a historical guild looking for very specific artefacts.</p>
    <p>The king turns to his sister, asking for her report. She says that all she’s heard of us is that we were very kind, and then the reports stopped when it got levelled. Master Greyjen vouches for us too, saying that it would take a lot of power to do the damage we supposedly did.</p>
    <p>The king understands their reasoning, but says it is massively suspicious. The Lord General agrees and says until we are proven innocent then we are to be held here.</p>
    <p>Tieron isn’t happy with that, understandably, pointing out that we have Orthon, and the people were comfortable with our conduct, but the king talks over him. Tieron insists, saying we minded our own business, and when we left the town was as it always was, potentially improved due to our intervention with the insects. He rolls a 25 on his persuasion check, and the king is conflicted with</p>
    <p>feeling responsible for an entire city being lost. And he says at the moment he can’t let us go, not trusting us because of the company we keep.</p>
    <p>He looks directly at Oriande when he says that, who looks both alarmed and confused, and just says “I’m not sure what you mean, your Majesty.” But the king dismisses it as another matter, returning to the issue of the town. Greyjen does still vouch for us, saying it could be a different threat, but Frissa shuts that down.</p>
    <p>Varic then takes the time to point out that he is the last of his clan, because his people were killed in a similar way to the people of Hitchem. He says they were attacked by a group of robed figures bearing the symbol that Greyjen has on his ring. The king appears sympathetic, but Varic says “Maybe you need to ask him.” Greyjen is the Lord Magus though, and the King backs him up.</p>
    <p>Tieron points out that the fact remains that two groups of people have been destroyed in the past few months. He says that though we may be accused of one, we can’t be responsible for both. But the king says there’s no proof that the events are related.</p>
    <p>All he wants from us at the moment is information. We don’t have much information to offer of our proof, other than that we weren’t there. The king says that there’s a lot of factors that paint us in a suspicious light and finds it strange that we’re collecting artefacts for magical purposes when we’re a historical guild.</p>
    <p>Since we have no further information to offer at that moment, the king returns to the matter of Oriande, and Orthon questions Oriande “being associated with a traitor”. The king decides to deal with that matter there and then, and asks if it’s a conversation Oriande would prefer to have in private. He says he has nothing to hide from his companions, as he’s done nothing wrong, so the king explains that Artus Mallorn and four of his sons assassinated three arch dukes (or tried to?), which is obviously treason.</p>
    <p>Oriande is understandably concerned and frustrated by this revelation, and asks if he can speak to his father. The king allows it, on the condition that they use Master Greyjen’s rings for telepathy, so that they can overhear the conversation between the two of them. It would be a chance to get a confession from Artus and also prove Oriande’s innocence.</p>
    <p>Though he doesn’t like the idea of someone being in his head, Oriande agrees to go with the guards to talk to his father. He’s taken away and returns half an hour later VERY unimpressed. Looks a bit shaken but also annoyed, which is rare. He takes off the ring and practically throws it back at Greyjen, glad to be done with that. His innocence proven, and Artus’ involvement confessed, the Lord General says that Artus will be executed within the week. Oriande points out that he might be more useful alive than dead, and that’s acknowledged but not commented upon.</p>
    <p>Shay gives the letter with Wolfgard’s seal to the king, and it turns out Frissa was the one who sent it. She wanted to test if we were capable of anything more than getting ourselves into trouble. She offers us a job in exchange for information of an item she thinks we might be interested in. Varic says he wants to talk to Greyjen.</p>
    <p>The king retires, as does the Lord General. Greyjen says he’ll be waiting for Varic, goes off on his way. We go to talk to Frissa first.</p>
    <p>She says she knows of two jobs they can do, which involve getting two different black glass artefacts. One she’ll think about more, but the first; “What do you know about pirates?” Tieron says he’s heard of The Admiral (leading pirates to raid traders and destroy ships etc), who she needs us to kill.</p>
    <p>Hitchum is in the great bay, which is where the pirates operate. He’s definitely a bad dude, so there is reason to kill him.</p>
    <p>Oriande also asks how many men work for him, needing to know how many healing spells to prep. In Tiffis, about a thousand people who live there, pirates and their wives, but has 120 rowers on the ship with him. Oriande asks which artefact he has, and they find out he’s currently in possession of the dioptre.</p>
    <p>We agree to do this, and she says that once we’ve dealt with that matter to come back to her for the next thing. We’re going to take a warp node to Arris, to get a ship from the mariner’s guild. When we’re done, head to Colvilla. Frissa leaves the room.</p>
    <p>Varic calls Greyjen back, but Oriande catches Greyjen on his way out of the room. Asks if he knew of what his father had said, and Greyjen admits to having heard whispers of that figure before, thinking it to be the same person as The Admiral. Oriande is not impressed, says that Greyjen should have looked into this as soon as he heard about it.</p>
    <p>“By the way my name’s Edwin Greyscythe, not Master Greyjen. That’s a thing.”</p>
    <p>Then he goes into the room to talk to Varic. They’re in there for a short while, and then Varic comes out to help the others move statue Artiti. </p>`

    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>Chat outside the palace</span></p>
    <p>Oriande insists that he needs to talk to everyone before they leave to go anywhere. We leave the palace and go to sit by the docks.</p>
    <p>Oriande explains that a man called Wordbringer came from across the sea. He comes from a land where a cult called the Order of the Fire Sermon have killed off their world gods, and intend to come to our land and do the same. They’re small in numbers, and have no symbol to identify them with, but they have “devilmen” on their side, fiends who are somewhere between a demon and a devil. Oriande explains what his father tried to do, and points out that Artus Mallorn was afraid of this cult and the power they wielded, which puts Oriande on edge because he’s never seen his father afraid of anything. The Order of the Fire Sermon worship a deity called Dominion, which is a name that also doesn’t fill Oriande with confidence.</p>
    <p>Hieronymous doesn’t want to talk about it much, but he explains why he has scars all over his face. He says he’s seen the creatures Oriande described. But he didn’t fight them, he ran.</p>
    <p>Tieron thanks Oriande for having the courage to tell them. Oriande suggests that Greyscythe hinted that the He knows that the Admiral has been active for maybe 6 years.</p>
    <p>Shay rolls a natural 20 on her perception check, and hears a muffled voice coming out of Orthon’s pack. Of course, it’s Princess Oliffe talking through the diadem. She has good news and bad news, so we ask for the bad news first. The bad news is that we have a month left before the apocalypse happens. Oriande and Hieronymous groan and lay down for a minute. Princess Oliffe tells us that the good news is that she knows where the ritual is going to take place; in the centre of the land should be a volcano, and that’s where they’ll be attempting their ritual.</p>

    <p>[<span class='italics '>We’re going to MORDOR, LADS</span>]</p>
    <p>Varic recognises the goliath’s tales of a great exploding stone (i.e. volcano). Princess Oliffe admits that it’s hard to keep continuing knowing she’ll fail, but Varic encourages her. When Shay asks about the Order of the Fire Sermon, and how other threats might affect the cycle, the princess suggests that things like the spawn of mlemfkngjkd might prove to be a problem. Apparently, we don’t hear</p>
    <p>the word clearly. But Oriande hears this and knows that “spawn of mlemfkngjkd” usually means Ossith, the god of death. The one that Varic sold his soul to. So, slight problem.</p>
    <p>Princess Oliffe asks us about what we’re like and about the people in our world.</p>
    <p>With time ticking on, and with all information shared, the party get on their way.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>Warping to Arris</span></p>
    <p>We warp as per usual and arrive in Arris.</p>
    <p>As we exit the warp node, we see a elf with big dark circles under his eyes, blonde hair. Princess Frissa had already sent word ahead, so there is a ship waiting etc. for us to travel with.</p>
    <p>We decide time is of the essence, so we go quickly.</p>
    <p>Tieron knows Arris well, and we follow him to the mariner’s guild. As he’s the only one who knows it, Tieron is the only one who notices that Arris has a very sour atmosphere at the moment – everyone looks very tired, the usual hustle and bustle is missing.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>The Mariner’s Guild</span></p>
    <p>We discover a huge, fort-like building standing on an outcrop of rock, waves crashing against the base. A large dock sits there as well. Oriande points out that it’s a very impressive building, but to Tieron it’s just home.</p>
    <p>A storm is rolling across the sea, quite far away, but it does begin raining.</p>
    <p>The gate is all completely shut up, the peephole closed. Varic knocks, hard. No response, until Shay calls out “Hello?” With a heavy sigh, a dwarf looks through the peephole.</p>
    <p>This dwarf is Gedrin, and he recognises Tieron at once. He tells us that he can’t let us in because the acting guild master has closed the guild to everyone. It turns out the acting guild master is Dilain, Tieron’s old rival. It was never anything too serious or intense, just that Tieron was slightly more skilled that Dilain and it caused a little bit of grief.</p>
    <p>Gedrin says that even though he doesn’t like the guild being closed off, it was done in response to a threat – The Admiral. They’re also afraid of a cult that have been plaguing Arris. Gatekeeper Marlon has been coming to the guild asking for help, the cult has been affecting people in town. So Dilain is afraid of both the Admiral, and the cult walking in.</p>
    <p>[Note: <span class='italics '>Gatekeeper is a guard of a warp node, whilst gatekeeper with a lower case is a guard who works on a gate. Gatekeepers (capital G) work 12 hour shifts.</span>]</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>Back in town</span></p>
    <p>We decide to go and talk to Marlon, as we can’t currently get into the guild. We ask Gedrin to pass on the message that we stopped by.</p>
    <p>We hurry to the gate, and find Marlon, the blonde elf we saw before. Tieron introduces himself and asks what he knows about the cult. Marlon says that we must have noticed how tired everyone was</p>
    <p>– the reason for this is because every time they go to sleep, the people of Arris have horrible nightmares. It’s taken its toll on the people.</p>
    <p>He suggests that we go and speak to his girlfriend, Faydi, who can tell us more. She is in the Sapphire Scale, the inn.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>The Sapphire Scale</span></p>
    <p>It’s actually pretty nice; the inn is clean, the furniture’s nice, there’s a quiet buzz in here. One of the only two people who really stand out are the only woman in the room; human woman, dressed quite provocatively. The second is a blue dragonborn, the barkeeper. Tieron recognises him – his name is Gargram.</p>
    <p>Tieron speaks to him, and Orthon introduces himself.</p>
    <p>After we all sit down with drinks, Tieron has a quick scout of Faydi, confirming that she probably is who we’re looking for. Varic chooses to approach her, quietly asks what she knows about the cult.</p>
    <p>Faydi calls Marlon a sweetheart (oof, friendzoned, sorry buddy), and says she’s not as bothered about the cult stuff as Marlon is. She suggests Varic talks to her in an empty booth, so they go and sit down. She tells him that she was allowed to attend a meeting.</p>
    <p>When asked, she says she wasn’t really listening, something about being anti-world gods, and how Dominion would rule all. Tieron joins them, and casts suggestion. The meeting took place about a month ago, during the early morning. Apparently their sermon was focused mostly on their “work beneath the earth.” She said there weren’t many cult members, but there were two devil creatures with them that unnerved her. Describes one of the devils in detail. Pretty sure most information about meetings etc. is passed by word of mouth.</p>
    <p>Tieron notices Gargram call Faydi over, ask her something, she answers, and he nods and goes back to what he was doing.</p>
    <p>Varic and Tieron return to the table to relay all the information.</p>
    <p>Tieron, Oriande and Shay decide to go for a walk around town, and on their way out of the inn they come across Marlon walking in. Oriande asks Marlon’s permission to cast Dispel Magic on him, to see if it alleviates the nightmares (Ori thinks it’s a curse that’s been put on the townspeople). Oriande rolls a nat 20 on his persuasion, so Marlon consents, and the spell is cast. Time will tell if it worked. The three of them carry on their walk after Marlon has a tiny bit of a breakdown and goes into the inn.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>On the walk</span></p>
    <p>Shay asks Tieron if there’s any smuggling or mining going on around town. There’s not really anything like that, most people go through the mariner’s guild for anything they want.</p>
    <p>The storm that was coming in over the sea is now starting to ramp up. Tieron still feels pretty at home, despite the gloom in town at the moment.</p>
    <p>The three of them go back to the tavern, regroup. Gargram rings the bell for last call.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>After we’ve gone to bed</span></p>
    <p>Shay’s dream: She’s back in Havertree and wakes up to the sound of screaming. People are running from flames, but she’s frozen in place.</p>
    <p>Orthon’s dream: Stuck in a black void, unable to escape, cry out or move.</p>
    <p>Tieron’s dream: He’s drowning. He’s unable to die though, his lungs filling with water.</p>
    <p>Hieronymous’ dream: Returns to his past experience, looking back into the void where devils and demons meet, except this time something reaches out. Hieronymous manages to roll a 19 in his strength test, struggling violently. As tendrils wrap around his neck, he rolls a 5 in his second strength contest.</p>
    <p>Which is lucky, because Oriande has to roll a strength contest, managing to get 17, and wakes up to Hieronymous strangling him. He manages to throw him off, backing up, coughing and wheezing. As soon as Hieronymous hits the ground he wakes up.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>In the morning</span></p>
    <p>Oriande asks what the hell just happened, and Hieronymous explains some of his nightmare.</p>
    <p>Varic notices that Orthon doesn’t look very good in the morning, and he recounts some of his nightmare to him. Didn’t wake up strangling Varic though. He says he had a feeling of nothingness.</p>
    <p>They all go downstairs, sharing their experiences, and Hieronymous nearly kills Oriande because of the suggestion that Hieronymous is twinkier than Oriande (which he is). Tieron suggests that Oriande switches rooms with someone else who can restrain Hieronymous if need be. Hieronymous suggests that Oriande could just tie him up to the bed if need be. Oriande is not entirely comfortable with the idea.</p>
    <p>Varic asks the barkeep if there are any caves or mines nearby, and it’s suggested that there will be some along the beach, so the goliath sweeps out.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>To the beach</span></p>
    <p>On the way to the beach at the north, they pass the warp node, where Marlon is standing, and Oriande quickly asks how his night was. Marlon says he wishes that he could give some good news, but he still had nightmares. He thanks Oriande for trying to help though.</p>
    <p>Orthon casts Divine Sense, and though he doesn’t feel anything around Marlon, he does sense something within Hieronymous. He pulls Hieronymous aside as they make their way to the beach, asking whether he’s had nightmares like that before. Hieronymous admits that he’s been trying to escape the feeling of the things from his past and is understandably horrified to think that this dark thing has been within him this whole time. Orthon offers him a willing ear whenever he needs.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>Along the beach</span></p>
    <p>On the way along the beach, the group don’t notice anything, but on the way back they see a gap in the cliffs. It’s about 9foot high and 5 foot wide. It’s wet, but we can enter.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><span class='underline bold'>In the cave</span></p>
    <p>The water is rising to about waist height, so Shay is on Varic’s shoulder. The rock to our right is jutting out to about shoulder height as we keep walking, and the narrow cave begins to widen.</p>
    <p>We reach the ledge, and Tieron climbs up. He manages to roll high on his stealth and perception, and sees five figures on the top. One of them is misshapen, but the rest seem to be humanoid. He relays the information back, and Orthon casts Divine Sense. He can tell the creature is a fiend. Also, Hieronymous is still a little bit fiendish.</p>
    <p>Tieron casts xx and makes one of the torches blow out, distracting one of the guards. When the guard goes to relight it, Oriande casts thaumaturgy to put it out again. The guard leaves to go and get another torch, thinking it’s a dud.</p>
    <p>The torch guy comes back, and Shay suggests we rush them because if we take them out, we can explore the rest of the cave. Tieron, Shay and Artiti attack first, because they’re the stealthiest. This means that all of the cultists are surprised and can’t act. We decide to capture the one with the red hood, and try and get information out of him.</p>
    <p>Tieron casts lightning bolt, dealing 24 lightning damage to one of the men and the demon, and 12 damage to the man who managed to pass the saving throw. The two men who were hit immediately drop dead, but the demon is still standing.</p>
    <p>Artiti activates his sharpshooter skill, aiming for the demon. He deals 56 damage total. The second shot pins the demon to the wall, and it falls limp.</p>
    <p>Shay scrambles forwards, ducking behind cover and shoots at the last guard, dealing 20 piercing damage. The bolt slams straight into his forehead, and he drops to the ground dead.</p>
    <p>Tieron casts chromatic orb, but the attack misses.</p>
    <p>Only the man in the robe remains. He casts Conjure Elemental, which is a problem. He runs, leaving the elemental in the room to deal with us.</p>
    <p>Artiti puts his hunter’s mark on the elemental, and uses his sniper shot. He deals 18 piercing damage. The head of the arrow goes in, but doesn’t do much more damage than that. He shoots again, but his second arrow misses.</p>
    <p>Varic transforms into his bear form, lighting his glaive on fire. He takes 5 damage. He runs in to engage.</p>
    <p>Orthon chases down the red hooded figure, and tries to use Hold Person, but it fails.</p>
    <p>Oriande casts Shield of Faith on Varic, giving him +2 to his AC, and then uses Sacred Flame on the elemental, dealing 13 radiant damage.</p>
    <p>Eldaril casts Flaming Sphere, which deals xx damage. It remains in place.</p>
    <p>Hieronymous isn’t feeling too good about fighting the elemental. Varic glances over his shoulder, yelling at Hieronymous “I’ve got this!” So H uses Step of the Wind, sprinting past the elemental and chasing after the red hooded figure. He uses stunning strike on red hood, successfully stunning him and dealing 6 damage. He then hits him again, dealing 7 damage.</p>
    <p>The elemental wildly flails at Varic, but misses. It takes 8 damage from Eldaril’s flaming sphere.</p>
    <p>Shay shoots at the elemental, but the bolt misses. She shouts to Orthon, yelling “get it get it get it!” which will give Orthon advantage on his next attack.</p>
    <p>Tieron turns to Oriande and Artiti, and saying “I’m gonna do something pretty big, but it’s going to be loud. Should I do it?” Oriande steps backwards, covering his ears. Tieron casts Thunder and deals 50 damage to the elemental.</p>
    <p>Artiti steps forwards, aiming at the elemental. He deals 54 damage.</p>
    <p>The elemental has chunks of it missing.</p>
    <p>Varic takes a swing, dealing 19 damage, chopping off the remains of its ruined arm. It’s just about still standing. He takes another swing but his glaive just glances off of it.</p>
    <p>Orthon steps forwards, slashing at the elemental, dealing 12 points of damage. The blade sinks into its chest, and it shatters apart.</p>
    <p>Oriande misses a turn by accident.</p>
    <p>Eldaril runs forwards, readying her bow in case the red hood tries to run.</p>
    <p>Hieronymous grapples the stunned red hood, pinning him to the wall. He manages to put the manacles on the red hood.</p>`
