He wears well maintained silver chain mail armour, which has gold highlights and the holy symbol of <span class='bold '>Uxen</span> in the center. He also wields a shield with the same holy symbol embraised onto it, as well as a simple mace in his right hand.</p>
      <p>He will often try to avoid violence whenever he can, but understands that it is at times the only way for though who are too far gone down the path of evil.</p>
      <p>Those who have spent some time with him will know the deep respect he has for the priest whom he trained under - <span class='bold '>Niccol√≤</span>.</p>`

      content: `<p>Towering grey skinned Goliath. Both face and hair are clean shaved. A strong furrowed brow shades eyes of deep crimson colouration. His powerful build and skin tone give him the impression of the mountains that he calls home. Something about the way he holds himself betrays a concealed animosity straining to be let free. Across his whole torso and head tribal tattoos of what look like stylized blue flames cover large portions of his skin. If you stare at them for long enough they almost look like they are swirling and dancing across his skin.</p>`
