    content: `<p>The world is much the typical fantasy setting. In this world, the beings of nature run rampant at night. Almost all villages, towns and cities live within some sort of wall – once a certain population level is reached, the Gods of Nature seems to want to reclaim the land as their own again. Only through at least a palisade can villages hide their presence from the natural forces, and only through large stone walls can towns and cities resist the attention they draw.</p>

    <p class="heading"><span class='underline'>The Originator Gods</span></p>
    <p>The creators of everything, these deities are the least concerned with mortal affairs. Rarely heard from, but their power and influence are felt daily in small ways by all in the mortal realm.</p>
    <p class=""><span class='bold '>Olsinger, God of life, healing and light.</span> Created the realm of mortals.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Ossith, God of souls, death, the afterlife and darkness.</span> Created mortality itself.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Eyuni, Goddess of divinity & mortality.</span> Creator of many of the Gods of Mortals.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Tesnix, Goddess of magic.</span> The most reclusive & mysterious of the gods.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Zo, Goddess of change and chaos.</span> Influential across the realms of the other deities, though mortals most associate her with disasters, plagues, violence and madness.</p>
    <p class="heading"><span class='underline'>The Gods of the Earth</span></p>
    <p>Spawn of Olsinger and Zo, created to empower the mortal realm as a potential weapon against Ossith long before mortals. Now their power is devoted to reclaiming their world back from the mortal races, and they oppose the more numerous yet weaker Gods of Mortals in this respect.</p>
    <p class=""><span class='bold '>Gallir, God of nature and the earth.</span> Father of many land-based natural races. His realm is the land.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Nepteri, Goddess of water and the sea.</span> In the summer months her seas are passable, but she conspires with Aver in the winter months to destroy trade and passenger ship alike.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Mathi, Goddess of fire.</span> Seldom is her influence present, but when it is it will strike with incredible force. Math's power is seen daily by the mortal races in their cooking and lighting, but they generally know better than to tempt her wrath beyond that.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Aver, God of the air and sky.</span> Aver is perhaps the least bothered by the presence of mortals, but will not hesitate to assist his coterie when it suits him.</p>
    <p class="heading"><span class='underline'>The Gods of Mortals</span></p>
    <p>Originally created by Eyuni, the Gods of Mortals were mostly created in moments of compassion. These gods both guide and protect mortals in various ways. Being the spawn of less than 2 patron/matron Originator Gods means they are the weakest gods, but what they lack in strength compared to the Gods of the Earth they make up for in numbers. The Gods of Mortals communicate with their subjects more frequently, as their direct intervention is often required in the absence of constant background power such as that seen in the Gods of the Earth.</p>
    <p class=""><span class='bold '>Ombrees, God of love, romance and courtship.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Ellein, Goddess of (reproductive) fertility, childbirth and parenthood.</span> Spawn of Olsinger.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Oynel, God of farming & fishing.</span> Spawned of Nepteri & Gallir in the early days of the mortal realm.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Uxen, God of charity and mercy.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Porss, God of discipline and restraint.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Ulmsi, Goddess of laws, rules and trade.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Alrea, God of hope, luck and fate.</span> Spawn of Zo.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Gensch, God of scholars, academia and wisdom.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Entex, God of martial ability, combat prowess and strength.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Vulci, Goddess of metal, craft and professions.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
    <p class="noPad"><span class='bold '>Esser, Goddess of music, joy and revelry.</span> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>

    content: `<p class="heading"><span class=''>Characters</span></p>
    <p>Please have a character concept in mind. As long as you can reasonably explain why your character does something, it’s fine and I won't be too pushy with this. No need for voices/accents, but do conversation in character. If you're going to struggle with coming up with a character or roleplaying it, you can do a self-insert as long as you're not silly with it.</p>
    <p class="heading"><span class=''>Resources</span></p>
    <p>Ignore resource management. We'll assume that you have enough food, resources etc. for your trips unless I state otherwise. This does not apply to items, potions etc.</p>
    <p class="heading"><span class=''>Experience</span></p>
    <p>Ignore – I’ll give you levels one by one, with extra rewards/levels if your RP/the plot furthers it.</p>
    <p class="heading"><span class=''>Movement</span></p>
    <p>We only account for movement roughly in combat as a lot of these sessions will be online. I'll rule whether things are in range.</p>
    <p class="heading"><span class=''>Injuries</span></p>
    <p>When you go down, roll a d10. On a roll of 2, you receive a minor injury of the DM's discretion. On a roll of 1, you receive a major injury of the DM's discretion.</p>`
