Almost all villages, towns and cities live within some sort of wall – once a certain population level is reached, the Gods of Nature seems to want to reclaim the land as their own again. Only through at least a palisade can villages hide their presence from the natural forces, and only through large stone walls can towns and cities resist the attention they draw.</p>`

<h3>The Originator Gods</h3>
<p class="c5">The creators of everything, these deities are the least concerned with mortal affairs. Rarely heard from, but their power and influence are felt daily in small ways by all in the mortal realm.</p>

<p><strong>Olsinger, God of life, healing and light.</strong> Created the realm of mortals.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Ossith, God of souls, death, the afterlife and darkness.</strong> Created mortality itself.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Eyuni, Goddess of divinity & mortality.</strong> Creator of many of the Gods of Mortals.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Tesnix, Goddess of magic.</strong> The most reclusive & mysterious of the gods.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Zo, Goddess of change and chaos.</strong> Influential across the realms of the other deities, though mortals most associate her with disasters, plagues, violence and madness.</p>

<br>
<h3>The Gods of the Earth</h3>
<p>Spawn of Olsinger and Zo, created to empower the mortal realm as a potential weapon against Ossith long before mortals. Now their power is devoted to reclaiming their world back from the mortal races, and they oppose the more numerous yet weaker Gods of Mortals in this respect.</p>

<p><strong>Gallir, God of nature and the earth.</strong> Father of many land-based natural races. His realm is the land.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Nepteri, Goddess of water and the sea.</strong> In the summer months her seas are passable, but she conspires with Aver in the winter months to destroy trade and passenger ship alike.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Mathi, Goddess of fire.</strong> Seldom is her influence present, but when it is it will strike with incredible force. Math's power is seen daily by the mortal races in their cooking and lighting, but they generally know better than to tempt her wrath beyond that.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Aver, God of the air and sky.</strong> Aver is perhaps the least bothered by the presence of mortals, but will not hesitate to assist his coterie when it suits him.</p>

<br>
<h3>The Gods of Mortals</h3>
<p>Originally created by Eyuni, the Gods of Mortals were mostly created in moments of compassion. These gods both guide and protect mortals in various ways. Being the spawn of less than 2 patron/matron Originator Gods means they are the weakest gods, but what they lack in strength compared to the Gods of the Earth they make up for in numbers. The Gods of Mortals communicate with their subjects more frequently, as their direct intervention is often required in the absence of constant background power such as that seen in the Gods of the Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Ombrees, God of love, romance and courtship.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Ellein, Goddess of (reproductive) fertility, childbirth and parenthood.</strong> Spawn of Olsinger.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Oynel, God of farming & fishing.</strong> Spawned of Nepteri & Gallir in the early days of the mortal realm.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Uxen, God of charity and mercy.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Porss, God of discipline and restraint.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Ulmsi, Goddess of laws, rules and trade.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Alrea, God of hope, luck and fate.</strong> Spawn of Zo.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Gensch, God of scholars, academia and wisdom.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Entex, God of martial ability, combat prowess and strength.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Vulci, Goddess of metal, craft and professions.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Esser, Goddess of music, joy and revelry.</strong> Spawn of Eyuni.</p>
<p class="c5"><strong>Pandrel, God of medicine and alchemy.</strong> Spawn of Olsinger.</p>`

    content: `<p>Please have a character concept in mind. As long as you can reasonably explain why your character does something, it’s fine and I won't be too pushy with this. No need for voices/accents, but do conversation in character. If you're going to struggle with coming up with a character or roleplaying it, you can do a self-insert as long as you're not silly with it.</p>
<p>Ignore resource management. We'll assume that you have enough food, resources etc. for your trips unless I state otherwise. This does not apply to items, potions etc.</p>
<p>Ignore experience – I’ll give you levels one by one, with extra rewards/levels if your RP/the plot furthers it.</p>
<p>We only account for movement roughly in combat as a lot of these sessions will be online. I'll rule whether things are in range.</p>

<h3>INJURIES</h3>
<p>When you go down, roll a d10. On a roll of 2, you receive a minor injury of the DM's discretion. On a roll of 1, you receive a major injury of the DM's discretion.</p>`
