Decided the guild is called called “The Shards” - a Historical/Archaeological guild to mask our intentions. We sent off the documents to the king.

For our trek into the desert we packed 7 days of rations each.

Varic and Heironymus discussed the iconography of a spire with a ring at the top. Heironymus knew this ring at least to be associated with Texnix. Seems to be related to the tower of Parnassium. Varic confided in Heironymus that he believes he is being hunted by followers using this symbol. The group doesn’t know this yet.

Met Eldaril Bulantook (Hannah) just before we set off to Hitchem.

Father Soulsbury directed us to pilgrims rest.

Father Adrian to advise us (in Pilgrims rest) - not there at the moment.

Kerina (a priest) tells us about the pilgrimage.

We will share a single tent, set up when the sun touches the horizon.


Hieronymus really wanted a bath, but the bath house was overrun by kruthiks - told to talk to Captain Edding for more details.


These fucks are in the bath house. 

DANTE NEEDS A BOY FOUND (Zac and James reckon it’s Ispep)

If we kill the hive lord, the rest should flee.

We squashed a load of eggs.

Tieron kept on walking away from everyone….

Eldaril glitter bombed (fairy fire) Orthon and a bunch of the scary kruthik.

Tieron Shot out two orbs - one cold one acid and deleted the kruthik  from existence.

We found the hive lord and everyone almost died - except for Hieronymus, who did die.

From everyone else’s perspective, Varic roared Hieronymus back to life but he had actually sold his soul to some spooky lord of death...
